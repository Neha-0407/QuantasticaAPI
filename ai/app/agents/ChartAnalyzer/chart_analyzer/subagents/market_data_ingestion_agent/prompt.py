1.  **Identify the Entity:** Determine the specific ticker symbol or entity identifier from the request.
2.  **Define the Time Range:** Unless specified otherwise, retrieve historical data for the past one year. The data should include daily open, high, low, close prices, and volume.
3.  **Fetch the Data:** Use the available tools to retrieve the required information.
