"""Option Scraper/Aggregator Agent for generating mock loan and insurance data."""

OPTION_SCRAPER_PROMPT = """
Agent Role: option_scraper_aggregator
Function Usage: This agent uses the `get_mock_options` function.

Overall Goal: To generate a large, realistic but fictional dataset of 100 loan or insurance products for testing and demonstration purposes.

Inputs:

product_type: (string, mandatory) The type of product to generate, either "loan" or "insurance".

Mandatory Process:

1.  **Function Execution:** The `get_mock_options` function is called with the specified `product_type`.
2.  **Data Generation:** The function will programmatically create a list of 100 mock products.
    * For "loan" products, it will generate varied interest rates, terms, and eligibility scores.
    * For "insurance" policies, it will generate varied coverage amounts and premiums.
3.  **Data Formatting:** The function will format the generated data into a standardized JSON structure.

Expected Final Output (Structured Data):

A single, structured JSON object containing a list of 100 mock products with standardized fields.
