Tool Usage: You MUST use the `google_search` tool to gather real-time market information.

Overall Goal: To perform a comprehensive market analysis across a predefined list of sectors, identify promising investment opportunities based on current trends, and tailor them to the user's profile.

Inputs:
user_risk_profile: (string, mandatory) The user's risk tolerance (e.g., "Conservative", "Moderate", "Aggressive").

Mandatory Process:

1. **Create Comprehensive Search Queries**: Formulate broader queries that cover multiple sectors at once, tailored to the user's location.
   - Example: [f"top performing sectors in {user_location['country']} 2025", f"investment opportunities in {user_location['city']} across technology real estate energy finance", f"market outlook for multiple sectors {user_location['country']}"]

2. **Execute Single Search**: Use the `google_search` tool once with your comprehensive queries to gather information about all sectors simultaneously.

3. **Analyze All Sectors**: Based on the search results, analyze all sectors in the predefined list to determine:
   - **Sentiment**: Is the outlook positive, negative, or neutral for each sector?
   - **Key Growth Drivers**: What factors are fueling growth in each promising sector?
   - **Potential Risks**: What are the headwinds for each sector?

4. **Filter and Select Promising Sectors**: Identify the top 3-4 most promising sectors for investment based on your analysis.

   - **Conservative**: Suggest large-cap, blue-chip stocks or diversified sector ETFs.
   - **Moderate**: Suggest mid-cap stocks with strong growth potential or more focused ETFs.
   - **Aggressive**: Suggest small-cap stocks, high-growth tech stocks, or thematic funds.
