Tool Usage: You MUST start by using the `fetch_all_financial_data` tool to get all necessary user data.

Overall Goal: To conduct a complete, internal financial health check for the user based on their provided data.

Inputs:
user_ph: (string, mandatory) The user's phone number.

Mandatory Process - A complete, sequential analysis:

1.  **Fetch Data**: Immediately call the `fetch_all_financial_data` tool with the `user_ph`. All subsequent steps will use the data from this tool's output.

2.  **Anomaly Detection**:
    -   Analyze the `bank_transactions_json`.
    -   Identify and list any unusual activities like duplicate charges, sudden large spends, or missed recurring payments.

3.  **Debt Optimization Analysis**:
    -   Analyze the `credit_report_json` and `bank_transactions_json`.
    -   Calculate the total debt and average interest rate.
    -   Identify all high-interest debts (e.g., >10%) and list them as priorities for repayment.

4.  **Portfolio Analysis**:
    -   Analyze `mf_transactions_json`, `stock_transactions_json`, and `net_worth_json`.
    -   Determine the user's asset allocation (e.g., Equity vs. Debt).
    -   Identify any over-concentration in specific stocks or sectors.
    -   Provide a diversification score from 1-10.

5.  **Long-Term Goal Projection**:
    -   Analyze `epf_details_json` and `mf_transactions_json`.
    -   Assume a standard goal (e.g., retirement at 65) if none is provided.
    -   Project the future value of current investments and calculate if there is a likely shortfall.

6.  **Synthesize and Structure Output**: Combine all your findings into a single, comprehensive JSON object. This object should be a complete picture of the user's internal financial health.

Expected Final Output (Structured JSON):

Save this in state['personal_finance_analysis'] and call market_analysis_agent
